🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in Python 🐍
Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe Game project, developed as part of my Python internship with Future Intern! This classic game lets you go head-to-head with the computer in a race to get three in a row.

🛠️ Project Overview
This project is a simple, interactive Tic Tac Toe Game where the player competes against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the objective is to place three of your marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before the computer does! It's a great way to practice game logic and user input validation in Python.

🚀 Key Features
Interactive Gameplay: Alternate turns between the player and computer on a 3x3 grid.
Win & Tie Detection: Automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.
Input Validation: Ensures the player can only pick valid, unoccupied spots on the grid.
Replay Option: After each round, the player can choose to play again or exit the game.

🎮"Rock, Paper, Scissors Game" in Python 🐍



🛠️ Project Overview:
I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game using Python, where the player competes against the computer in a classic face-off. The game allows players to choose between rock, paper, or scissors, while the computer randomly selects its move. The program then determines the winner using the timeless game rules.

🚀Key Features:

-Randomized Computer Choice: The computer randomly generates its choice, adding an element of surprise to each round.
-Input Validation: Ensures that the player's input is valid (rock, paper, or scissors) and prompts them to re-enter if necessary.
-Instant Feedback: The game immediately displays the results, showing the player’s choice, the computer’s choice, and whether it’s a win, loss, or draw.
-Replay Functionality: After each game, players can choose to play again or exit, enhancing the experience with multiple rounds.

🔐 Random Password Generator

Welcome to my Random Password Generator project, developed as part of my Python internship with Future Intern! This tool generates secure, random passwords to help ensure your accounts are safe from unauthorized access.

🛠️ Project Overview This project creates a powerful Random Password Generator that outputs passwords with a customizable length and combination of characters. It’s designed to provide strong passwords by incorporating uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, making it ideal for secure account creation and password updates.

🚀 Key Features Customizable Password Length: Choose how many characters your password should have, offering flexibility in password strength. Character Variety: Includes a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters for maximum security. User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive prompts for entering your preferences. Highly Secure: Generates unpredictable and unique passwords that are hard to crack. Replay Option: After generating a password, you can easily generate another one without restarting the program.
